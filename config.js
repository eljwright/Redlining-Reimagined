        "To understand the practice of and impacts of redlining, we must first understand the historical context. In the aftermath of the Great Depression, president Franklin Delano Roosevelt started implementing what he called New Deal programs. These programs aimed to create social safety nets and promote economic recovery after the depression. As part of the New Deal, FDR established the Homeowners Loan Corporation (HOLC) and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) in an attempt to expand homeownership and make it more accessible for Americans. These programs helped make homeownership a central part of the “American Dream,” but they were implemented in discriminatory ways that excluded many people of color (POC) and low-income communities from accessing those benefits and building wealth through homeownership.<sup>2</sup>",

      description:
        'One way housing discrimination occurred in Seattle was through the Homeowners Loan Corporation (HOLC). The HOLC, saying they were worried about taking on risky loans, made color-coded maps to assess the riskiness of granting home loans in different neighborhoods. These maps were created for every major American city, including Seattle in 1936. The maps included four different residential grades that neighborhoods would be ranked into. <br><br>These residential grades were as follows:<br><span style="display:inline-block; width:15px; height:15px; background-color: #588c73; border: 1px solid #588c73; vertical-align:middle; margin-right:5px;"></span><strong>A. Best</strong> (Green)<br><span style="display:inline-block; width:15px; height:15px; background-color: #52749A; border: 1px solid #52749A; vertical-align:middle; margin-right:5px;"></span><strong>B. Still Desirable</strong> (Blue)<br><span style="display:inline-block; width:15px; height:15px; background-color: #f5d56c; border: 1px solid #f5d56c; vertical-align:middle; margin-right:5px;"></span><strong>C.

Hazardous</strong> (Red)<br><br>After these maps were created, they were adopted by the FHA as well as private banks to inform their decisions on who to lend to. This meant that families and individuals in the C and D graded neighborhoods (Yellow and Red respectively) would be systematically denied home loans, which is where the term redlining comes from.',

        "Another example that showcases the clear racist nature of the redlining map was that in addition to the loan security map, the HOLC also created a racial map that showed the areas certain ethnicities were the most present in. In addition to showing where certain racial groups lived, the HOLC racial map also included arrows that showed the “direction of infiltration” of those groups. This is likely a direct reference to the FHA’s Underwriting Manual which warned housing developers, without sufficient evidence, that property values would be threatened by the “infiltration of inharmonious racial groups”.<sup>9</sup> This map was submitted on the same day and by the same HOLC field agent as the mortgage security redlining map, and is a clear demonstration that the HOLC was always considering racial factors in their maps.",

        'Although redlining was finally outlawed at the federal level and local levels in 1968 with the Fair Housing Act and Fair Housing Ordinance (Ordinance 96619) respectively,<sup>19</sup> elements of the practice persisted for several years. In 1975 the Central Seattle Community Council Federation published a report titled Redlining and Disinvestment in Central Seattle that outlined how even after this legislation, residents of the Central District, a redlined zone, still faced major barriers to receiving home loans.<sup>20</sup> After this report was published, several local government initiatives were undertaken as an attempt to reverse the effects of redlining, these include Seattle’s Reinvestment Task Force (established 1975) and the Lenders Review Board (est 1976).<sup>21</sup> <br><br>Despite efforts from the city government, redlining still has a mjaor impact on Seattle today.

        'One of the most prominent effects of redlining is that it prevented people in redlined neighborhoods from being able to own homes and build generational wealth.

A recent <a href="https://econw.com/project/redlining-and-wealth-loss-measuring-the-impacts-of-racist-housing-practices-in-king-county-wa/" target="_blank">ECONorthwest study </a><sup>22</sup> found that without racially discriminatory housing practices (including redlining but also practices such as racial housing covenants and private discrimination) King County’s BIPOC households would hold between $12 and $34 billion in additional wealth today. Additionally they found that each individual Black household in King County would hold between $105,000 to $306,000 in additional wealth today if it weren’t for this racial discrimination in housing.  <br><br> These wealth disparities impact more than just finances, they also have a significant influence on things such as education<sup>23</sup> or health.<sup>24</sup>',

      description:
        'On top of the severe wealth disparity faced by residents of redlined neighborhoods, redlining also caused disinvestment which has continued to impact communities for decades. The 1975 report Redlining and Disinvestment in Central Seattle defines disinvestment as “a general policy followed by banks of taking in savings deposits from residents of a redlined area but refusing to return that money, in the form of home, business, and consumer loans, to the community that provided the money”.<sup>20</sup><br><br>This practice goes against how banks are intended to function. Normally, money individuals deposit into banks will later be reinvested back into the same community it came from, by supporting home ownership, local businesses, and public infrastructure like schools. But in redlined areas, banks refused to give loans to the people living there. Instead, the money local residents deposited into banks would be sent to support the development of wealthy suburbs outside the city.<sup>20</sup><br><br>This turned redlining into a self-fulfilling prophecy. By denying access to loans and reinvestment, banks caused redlined neighborhoods to deteriorate, justifying their original “hazardous” designations and blaming residents for the conditions the banks themselves caused. This lack of investment is more than just an economic issue. It has contributed to crumbling infrastructure, underfunded schools, and limited job opportunities. These consequences continue to affect formerly redlined communities today and play a major role in the continued inequality within Seattle.<br><br><img src="images/Redlining_and_Disinvestment.jpg" alt="image of the cover of the Redlining and Disinvestment in Central Seattle Report">Redlining and Disinvestment in Central Seattle Report<sup>20</sup>',

        'Redlining and the disinvestment it caused left certain communities, particularly those that were redlined, more vulnerable to gentrification. <b>Gentrification is the process in which lower-income urban neighborhoods undergo demographic shifts due to increased investment in the area and wealthier individuals moving in.</b><sup>28</sup> Gentrification often leads to displacement of long-term residents, as increased investment drives up rent prices, making it unaffordable for them to stay.<sup>28</sup> Gentrification disproportionately affects formerly redlined neighborhoods due to their history of disinvestment, often forcing people out of the only neighborhoods they were historically allowed to live in.<sup>27</sup><br> <br> While this issue affects many American cities, the tech economy of Seattle makes these trends even more apparent. In 2019, Seattle was named the <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/data/seattle-ranks-near-top-for-gentrification-but-that-might-not-be-as-bad-as-you-think-study-finds/3rd" target="_blank"> third most gentrifying US city.</a><sup>29</sup> Gentrification and displacement illustrate that housing inequality is not only the result of poor government policy but that corporations also bear a significant portion of the responsibility. In Seattle, these corporations play a key role in the gentrification of formerly redlined zones, as they bring an influx of out-of-towners who often desire to live in the city center.<sup>27</sup> In addition to the population growth they cause, Seattle corporations have been described as <a href="https://systemicjustice.org/article/redlining-and-disinvestment-a-case-study-on-racial-segregation-and-gentrification-throughout-seattles-central-district/" target="_blank">“[capturing] the city’s political and economic landscape”</a>, leveraging their power to block affordable housing initiatives.<sup>27</sup>',

Similarly to the Central District, redlining caused a severe lack of investment in Rainier Valley which has continued to affect its neighborhoods for decades.<br><br>The Rainier Valley also faces another issue which stems from the city expanding its light rail service to the area in the name of “Transit Oriented Development”. This has played into the gentrification of the valley, as the new stations have brought increased development that has significantly changed the character of the neighborhood.<sup>30</sup> In particular, areas around the light rail stations have seen dramatic increases in rent and land values.<sup>31</sup>",

It also shows how gentrification doesn’t just affect renters, as it can cause property taxes that homeowners pay to increase.<br><br>Finally, even for renters that can afford to stay in the area as it gentrifies, rising housing prices often make it impossible for them to ever buy their own home. In Rainier Beach, average home values have increased by almost $170,000 in the past five years.<sup>34</sup> This perpetuates the same trends that redlining caused in the first place, keeping homeownership firmly out of reach for many Seattlites.<br><br><img src="images/LawnSign_2.jpg"><br>Lawn Sign in the lawn of Reagan Jackson<sup>32</sup>',

It also gives us the power to challenge them and push for better solutions going forward.<br><br>Now you have the opportunity to continue exploring the legacy of redlining on your own terms. <b>Use the comparison map below </b>to compare the original HOLC zones (left) to the RSE Composite Index (right), to explore connections of redlining to modern day inequality. Use the map to look at your own neighborhood or explore areas you care about, and consider what this history means for the future of our city.",
