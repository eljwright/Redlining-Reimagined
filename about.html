      <h1>About This Project</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Redlining Reimagined</b> is an educational website designed for high school and university students in the Seattle area. It was created as my final year capstone project for my BA in Digital Cultures and Media at Newcastle University. My aim was to create an engaging way for students to learn about the history and legacy of redlining in their own city. Through the two primary components, the story map and the comparison map, it aims to deepen understanding of systemic racial inequalities and encourage critical reflection on their lasting impact in Seattle.

      <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
      <p>
        I would like to acknowledge the following individuals who made this research project possible: <br><br>First and foremost, thank you to my supervisor, Dr. Alex Tarr. This project genuinely would not have been possible with all your support, encouragement, and guidance. It means a lot to have someone who believed in my ideas and my ability to create what became a true passion project.<br><br>I’m also grateful to the rest of the Digital Cultures team at Newcastle for all your support, particularly with the intricacies of building a working website and for encouraging me to take on a practical project in the first place.<br><br>Thanks as well to all my friends, who not only offered some much-needed distractions but also gave thoughtful feedback on my website.<br><br>A special thanks to the Wing Luke Museum in Seattle for taking the time to provide me with valuable information that helped inform my project. I also made use of publicly available resources from the Mapping Inequality project and the City of Seattle’s Racial and Social Equity (RSE) Index, both of which provided essential data.<br><br>And finally, thank you to my family for all your long-distance support and feedback. A special shoutout to my mom and my sibling Stella for putting up with me constantly talking about this project. I unfortunately can’t promise it’ll stop now.
